=========================================================================================================


10 Questions that are mostly asked for 2-5 years’ experience are;

Which is better between two different versions of android?

What will you do to develop a secure Android Application?

1. What is assert? Where will you use it?

2. How do you find memory leaks in Android application? (LeakCanary can be used or by chking root cause on Android Monitor)

3. Explain about any exception which you have handled in your application? (ClassNotFoundException, NullPointerException)

4. How will you design a ListView which downloads lot of images and displays in it without getting your app getting hanged? What’s the best possible way to do
(2 ways to do it, 1. Using ListViewActivity class which contains both image and text in the layout and using AsyncTask to fetch the images in the background
and displaying it. 2. Using Thread and Handler to fetch the images and feed to the UI thread where we have ListViewActivity to populate and show, better way 
would be to use AsyncTask using lazy loader, so that application doesnt hang and images are loaded as we scroll down.)
